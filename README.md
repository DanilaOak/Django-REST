# Django-REST

Create a REST service in which there will be an opportunity to perform CRUD operations on the Task entity.

Verification of the right to perform the operation must be implemented using the token transmitted in the request. 
The token must have access rights (read, update, delete).

Tokens should be generated by a special endpoint.

Cover the code with tests
